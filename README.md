# ASL Fingerspelling Recognition
## Overview
This repository contains the codebase for a custom Transformer-based deep learning model designed for real-time American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling recognition. The primary goal of this project is to enable the translation of fingerspelled ASL characters into readable text, contributing to the development of AI solutions that make technology more accessible for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community.

## Competition Context
This project was developed in response to a competition focused on detecting and translating ASL fingerspelling into text. The competition's aim is to address the accessibility gap in voice-enabled assistants and AI solutions for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community. The provided dataset includes over three million fingerspelled characters captured through smartphone selfie cameras, presenting a unique and challenging real-world scenario.

## Key Features
### Custom Transformer Model:
  Developed a specialized deep learning model using a custom Transformer architecture.
### Data Preprocessing:

  Preprocessed the ASL fingerspelling dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring uniform sequence lengths for effective model training.
### Data Augmentation Techniques:
  Implemented data augmentation techniques, including random rotation and flipping of sequences, to improve the model's ability to generalize to different variations of fingerspelled signs.

### TensorFlow and Keras Implementation:
  Utilized TensorFlow and Keras frameworks to build and train the Transformer model.
  Model architecture consists of multiple self-attention layers, feed-forward neural networks, and positional encodings.

## Competition Impact
This project aligns with the competition's mission to advance sign language recognition technology. Successful models developed from this codebase have the potential to enhance the accessibility of AI solutions for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community, contributing to real-world applications such as convenient text entry and improved communication.
